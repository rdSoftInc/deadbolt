# iOS Test Targets

This directory is reserved for iOS application packages (`.ipa`) used for
testing and evaluation of Deadbolt’s iOS static analysis pipeline.

---

## Current Status

At present, no iOS test application is included in this repository.

Unlike Android APKs, iOS IPA files are not commonly distributed publicly due to
Apple’s platform restrictions and code-signing requirements.

---

## Intended Use

This directory exists to support:

- Internal or authorized testing where a legally obtained IPA is available
- Research and development of Deadbolt’s iOS analysis features

---

## Notes

- Do **not** add IPA files unless you have explicit permission to analyze them
- Use only test applications or apps you own the rights to
- Keep all testing within legal and ethical boundaries
