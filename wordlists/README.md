# Wordlists

This directory contains wordlists used by Deadbolt for deterministic and
reproducible discovery and fuzzing workflows.

## common.txt

The `common.txt` wordlist is derived from the following upstream source:

- **Project:** auto-recon  
- **Author:** Ivan Šincek  
- **Repository:** https://github.com/ivan-sincek/auto-recon  
- **Original file:**  
  https://github.com/ivan-sincek/auto-recon/blob/main/src/auto_recon/wordlists/raft_small_directories_lowercase.txt

The list has been reused for endpoint discovery purposes in Deadbolt.
Any modifications (such as trimming, deduplication, or reformatting)
are the responsibility of this project.

All credit for the original wordlist goes to the original author.
